# Real Estate App

Created an app for Real Estate to list their properties and save them.

  - Used Andular CLI to create this project
  - Bootstrap4 and SCSS

### Tech

* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - fast node.js network app framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - CSS preprocessor 

### Installation

Open Terminal/Command prompt on your system.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/innovativeGem/rea-app.git
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ ng build
```

### Plugins


### Development Status

What i managed to achieve so far?

> Added 2 columns for property list and Saved properties
> Loaded Mock JSON data into my application
> Create a Service to load JSON data
> Added another child Property component to hold my card template
> Make app responsive
> Click on the "Save" button shows property id in console.log() window

### Hick-ups
Due to time constrains i was not able to
 - make the button show only on card roll-over
 - Add property to Saved list when clicked and vise versa
 - Unit tests

### Next steps

 - Fix the mouseover event on card to show button only on roll-over
 - Add property to Saved list when clicked and vise versa
 - Unit tests

Regards!
