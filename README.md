# Rea App

Created an app for Rea Group to list their properties and save them.

### Tech

* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - fast node.js network app framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - CSS preprocessor 

### Installation

Open Terminal/Command prompt on your system.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/innovativeGem/rea-app.git
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ ng build
```
